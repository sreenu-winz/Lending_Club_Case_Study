## General Information
- The Objective of this case study is to implement EDA techniques on a real world problem and understand the insights and showcase in a presentation.
- Benefits of the case study:
-It gives an idea about how EDA is used in real life business problems.
-It also helps us develop a basic understanding of importance of risk analytics in banking and financial services industry.
-It helps us to see how the data is used to minimize loss of money to banks while lending it to customers.
-It improves our understating of visualization and what charts to use for real life data.
- The business objective is to take a decision on a loan application to whether to reject or approve the loan based on certain variables.
- The given data contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. Data has details regarding approved loan not the rejected ones. It has 3 status of loan which is Fully Paid, Current and Charged-Off.

## Conclusions
- Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the chance of defaulting and avoiding Credit Loss:
- DTI 
- Grades
- Verification Status
- Annual income
- Pub_rec_bankruptcies

1. Burrowers not from large urban cities like California, new york, texas, florida etc 

2. Burrowers having annual income in the range 50000-100000

3. Burrowers having Public Recorded Bankruptcy

4. Burrowers with least grades like E,F,G which indicates high risk

5. Burrowers with very high Debt to Income value
  
6. Burrowers with working experience 10+ years
